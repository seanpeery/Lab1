Lab1 Feedback
Your repository had a file called "ignore.gitignore". This file is usually just called ".gitignore" (it begins with a period).

You should update the comments in lang.l

Your scanner did not handle some whitespace. As a result, blank lines were 
output to cout.

You handled specific characters as junk. If you take this approach, you need to be sure to handle EVERY character that might appear in the input stream. It is better to use a wildcard. The following would do:

.       {return JUNK_TOK;}

LATE

Your build has warnings.

The code I pulled from your repository appears to be for Lab 1, not Lab 3.
